agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance

This module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.

It provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,
which is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP
client requests will use.

The `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or
another `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be
asynchronous (by defining an `async` function).

Instances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`
modules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`
function includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked
to determine what type of socket should be returned.

#### Some subclasses:

Here are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`
based on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both
the `http` and `https` modules.

```ts
import * as net from 'net';
import * as tls from 'tls';
import * as http from 'http';
import { Agent } from 'agent-base';

class MyAgent extends Agent {
  connect(req, opts) {
    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the "https" module
    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
      return tls.connect(opts);
    } else {
      return net.connect(opts);
    }
  }
});

// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be
// invoked when a new connection needs to be created
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request
http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

The Node.js's missing `keep alive` `http.Agent`. Support `http` and `https`.

## What's different from original `http.Agent`?

- `keepAlive=true` by default
- Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)`
- Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue.
- Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install agentkeepalive --save
```

## new Agent([options])

* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.
  Can have the following fields:
  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by
    other requests in the future. Default = `true`.
  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay
    for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.
    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout
    after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.
    Default is `15000`.
    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout
    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.
    Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.
  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per
    host. Default = `Infinity`.
  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open
    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
    Default = `256`.
  * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.
    If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)
    Default = `null`.

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');

const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10,
  timeout: 60000,
  freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds
});

const options = {
  host: 'cnodejs.org',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = http.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});
req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {
    console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
  }
}, 2000);

```

### `getter agent.statusChanged`

counters have change or not after last checkpoint.

### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`

`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:

```js
{
  createSocketCount: 10,
  closeSocketCount: 5,
  timeoutSocketCount: 0,
  requestCount: 5,
  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },
  sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },
  requests: {}
}
```

### Support `https`

```js
const https = require('https');
const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;

const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();
// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
const options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
}, 2000);
```

degenerator
===========
### Compiles sync functions into async functions

Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood.
This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and
returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into `async`
functions.

So this:

```js
function foo() {
  return a('bar') || b();
}
```

Gets compiled into:

```js
async function foo() {
    return await a('bar') || await b();
}
```

With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module
in Node.js, or save the code to a file and require it, or whatever.

Example
-------

You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be
"asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did
and HTTP request and returned the response body.

The user has provided us with this implementation:

``` js
function myFn() {
  const one = get('https://google.com');
  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');
  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));
  return [one, two, three];
}
```

Now we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the
async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function
instance with the `vm` module:


```typescript
import vm from 'vm';
import { degenerator } from 'degenerator';

// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)
function get(endpoint: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');
    var req = mod.get(endpoint);
    req.on('response', function (res) {
      var data = '';
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });
      res.on('end', function () {
        resolve(data);
      });
    });
  });
}

// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)
str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);

// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance
const asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });

// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously
asyncFn().then((res) => {
  // Do something with `res`...
});
```

### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>): String

Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.

Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

```ts
import * as https from 'https';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');

https.get('https://example.com', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org', { agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy: string | URL, options?: HttpsProxyAgentOptions)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.

The `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and
some additional properties:

 * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server
   in the `CONNECT` request.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - netmask@2.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Netmask
=======

The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.

Synopsis
--------

```js
var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask

var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');
block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0
block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0
block.bitmask;                  // 12
block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255
block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255
block.size;                     // 1048576
block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1
block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254

block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true
block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true
block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false

block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));

block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')
```

Constructing
------------

Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:

```
'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.
'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00
'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.
'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form
'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form
```

API
---

- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address
- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.
- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.
- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')

Installation
------------

    $ npm install netmask

Run all tests (vows plus mocha)

pac-proxy-agent
===============
### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or
SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the
HTTP endpoint.

It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.

Example
-------

```ts
import * as http from 'http';
import { PacProxyAgent } from 'pac-proxy-agent';

const agent = new PacProxyAgent('pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+');

http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - pac-resolver@7.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

pac-resolver
============
### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia]


This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous
`FindProxyForURL()` function.

Example
-------

Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:

```js
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {
    return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";
  } else {
    return "DIRECT";
  }
}
```

You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { createPacResolver } from 'pac-resolver';

const FindProxyForURL = createPacResolver(readFileSync('proxy.pac'));

const res = await FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/');
console.log(res);
// "DIRECT"
```


API
---

### pac(qjs: QuickJSWASMModule, pacFileContents: string | Buffer, options?: PacResolverOptions) → Function

Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS
string `pacFileContents` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be
passed in which respects the following options:

 * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.
 * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the
 JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to
 include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For
 async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function
 instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were
 synchronous.

 The `qjs` parameter is a QuickJS module instance as returned from `getQuickJS()` from the `quickjs-emscripten` module.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

proxy-agent
===========
### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation which automatically uses
proxy servers based off of the various proxy-related environment variables
(`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` among others).

Which proxy is used for each HTTP request is determined by the
[`proxy-from-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) module, so
check its documentation for instructions on configuring your environment variables.

An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for
subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:

Example
-------

```ts
import * as https from 'https';
import { ProxyAgent } from 'proxy-agent';

// The correct proxy `Agent` implementation to use will be determined
// via the `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `no_proxy` / etc. env vars
const agent = new ProxyAgent();

// The rest works just like any other normal HTTP request
https.get('https://jsonip.com', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```


API
---

### new ProxyAgent(options?: ProxyAgentOptions)

Creates an `http.Agent` instance which relies on the various proxy-related
environment variables. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance
will be returned if identical args are passed in.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Sinch RTC SDK - JavaScript

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Note about running `make` on M1 / M2 chipsets (arm64 architecture)

On new Apple Mac chipsets you may encounter following error:

    source _nix.sh && nix-shell --pure --run 'sh nix-export-env.sh' > .nixenv.include.sh.tmp
    error: assertion '((stdenv).isDarwin && (stdenv).isx86_64)' failed

As a workaround add following entry to your local `/etc/nix/nix.conf` file:

    system = x86_64-darwin

Build tools are installed using [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) package manager. To install a local devenv, run:

    make devenv

In the root of this repository run:

    make sync

This will

- Sync git submodules.
- Set up npm environment [https://www.npmjs.com/]

When the script finishes, it should be possible to run.

    make serve

this will build the sdk and start a local http server on port 5050 if everything works you should be able to load [http://localhost:5050/reference-apps/javascript/samples/]

## Build and Test Sdk

### Build

    make build

### Generate ocra api from ocra design

    make ocra

### Build and start local http server

    make serve

### Tests

    make test

### Create the jssdk package

    make dist

## E2E Smoke test

### Build Sdk for E2E smoke test

    make bidiro

### Build and start local host for running test host app

    make bidiro-serve

This will start a local webserver at port 1080 and a WebSocket proxy listening on port 3000. To run the test host app use <http://localhost:1080/sinch/{channel}/?sdk={sdk}>

{channel} is an identifier for the channel and can be any string. WebSocket message to this app should be sent to http://{host}:3000/bidiro/{channel}

{sdk} is the folder where the sdk is located. By defaulr {sdk} is "sdk" which is the folder where the local built (make bidiro) sdk is located.

### Running E2E Tests inside docker locally

`npm run e2e`

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have cloned the [E2E repository](https://gitlab.com/sinch/sinch-projects/voice/rtc-sdk-e2e-test) in your home directory
2. The JS sdk and E2E respository are in the same parent directory
3. Docker or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed on your machine
4. Replace `localhost` with `bidirohost` for `sinch.device.1` and `sinch.device.1` in `parameters-js-v2.xml`.

### Design

For design document, see [design/README.md](design/README.md)

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Examples
--------

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

https.get('https://ipinfo.io', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

var socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.events', { agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```
